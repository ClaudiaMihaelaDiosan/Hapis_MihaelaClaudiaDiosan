    <string name="andrew_story">I made a mistake when I was younger and got caught smoking dope. I ended up having to do a short prison sentence.
I ended up being homeless on the streets on and off. I would sleep rough for a few weeks or a month. I served a few spells in prison but I would usually end up on the streets again as when I got out I had nowhere to live.</string>
    <string name="maria_story">I have been homeless twice – once when I was 23 and again at 30. Both times it was due to mental health problems.
The first time it happened I left my job because I wasn’t well. I went to stay with my parents, but it didn’t work out and my dad asked me to leave. Then I went to stay with friends.
The second time I became homeless it followed a similar pattern. I had been working part-time in a shop but ended up leaving. So I had no job and rent to pay. </string>
    <string name="maite_story">My husband and I split up in 2014 after he was arrested for beating me up badly. I was only working part time and had nowhere to stay with the children, onlysometimes with my mum.In the end we live for rent and I try to give them the best with the help we have.</string>
